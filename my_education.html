        <h2>Summary of Education</h2>
        <p>The early years in kindergarten were all about learning through play and curiosity, but they weren’t without their challenges. I remember feeling a bit scared at first because I was the youngest in my class. Before joining Q-Dees when I was 5, I had attended a Chinese kindergarten, so the transition wasn’t entirely new, but it was different. Q-Dees provided a solid foundation for developing a love for learning and building social skills.</p>
        <p>Moving on to primary school, I started at SK Jalan 3 and was there until Year 4. It was an important period where I learned to adapt to new situations and made lifelong friends. At the end of Year 4, life took an unexpected turn when I transferred to SK Pakatan Jaya in Ipoh, Perak, to live with my grandmother. My mom was unwell, and my dad needed to be there for her, so I stayed with my grandmother during that time. Despite the challenges, I thrived academically, always striving to do my best. I was proud to maintain the top spot in my class right up until graduation. That period taught me resilience and the importance of family support.</p>
        <p>High school was a significant chapter that pushed me further and opened my mind to new interests. From Form 1 to Form 5, I attended SMK Bandar Seri Putra (BSP), a school known for its friendly atmosphere and strong sense of community. During Form 1 to Form 3, I was part of the KAA class, where we focused on Arabic, which gave me a unique and enriching experience. It was like being in a special school within a school because we were the only KAA class. In Form 4, I took on the challenges of Additional Mathematics, Accounting, and Business, which sparked a deep interest in analytical thinking and problem-solving. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for subjects that require logical reasoning and critical thought.</p>
        <p>My time in high school was not just about academics. I was a library prefect, and that role taught me responsibility and how to work as part of a team. Our uniforms were green, and I wore them with pride. I joined a range of extracurricular activities to broaden my horizons and pick up new skills. I started playing hockey back in primary school at SK Jalan 3 and continued in high school. Netball was another sport I loved; I joined in Form 1 and represented my school, even going on to compete at the district level. I was also active in the KAFA class, representing my school in competitions up to the Hulu Langat district, where I won first place in the syarahan contest. It was an experience that not only improved my public speaking but also boosted my confidence.</p>
        <p>These early experiences, from kindergarten to high school, were more than just a path of academic achievement; they were about growing as a person, developing resilience, and learning to balance work and play. Each stage of my education laid the groundwork for what came next and prepared me for the challenges of higher education.</p>
