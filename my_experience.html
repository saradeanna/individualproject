            <h2>Early Career and Work Experience</h2>
            <p>After SPM, I jumped straight into working to support myself and save up for my diploma. My first job was at Lotus's Malaysia as a cashier from March 2022 to September 2022. I worked there until right before my MDS (minggu destini siswa) at UiTM Rembau Campus started, marking the beginning of my first semester. The job was a big deal for me, as it helped me cover my living expenses and save up for what I needed.</p>
            <p>At first, working as a cashier was pretty intimidating. Dealing with so many customers every day made me nervous, but it was a game-changer for me. I got used to chatting with people and handling all kinds of situations, which boosted my confidence and improved my social skills. I went from being shy and quiet to talking more freely and confidently. My personality even shifted from being introverted (I) to extroverted (E) — who would have thought?</p>
            <p>During semester breaks, I kept working to make sure I had enough for the next semester. I took on different roles to get more experience and earn money. I taught Arabic and looked after kids at Tadika Dzul Iman, which had a nursery. That job taught me patience, creativity, and how to engage with children in a fun and educational way. I also worked at KK Supermart and a school uniform shop. At KK, I had to lift heavy boxes to organize them on shelves, which really helped me build physical strength and resilience. Handling that kind of work pushed me to be tougher, both mentally and physically. At the school uniform shop, I learned the ins and outs of customer service, managing sales, and handling inventory.</p>

            <h2>School Transitions and Adaptability</h2>
            <p>Throughout my early years, changing schools was a big part of my life, and each transition came with its own set of challenges and learnings. I started at a Chinese kindergarten, where I was the youngest in my class. This early experience was both exciting and challenging, as I had to keep up with older peers in a new environment. It taught me adaptability and how to find my place in unfamiliar situations, laying the groundwork for my learning habits and resilience.</p>
            <p>After that, I moved to Q-Dees kindergarten, which was a fresh start with a different group of friends and activities. The change was easier compared to the first, and it helped me develop new social skills and confidence. The experience of being in different settings at such a young age taught me how to adjust quickly and build relationships.</p>
            <p>When it came to primary school, I started at SK Jalan 3, but things changed when I transferred to SK Pakatan Jaya in Ipoh, Perak, to live with my grandmother. This move was necessary due to my mother's illness and my father needing to focus on caring for her. Adjusting to a new school in a different city was tough, especially getting used to new teachers and classmates. However, it turned out to be a turning point for me academically. I thrived at SK Pakatan Jaya, consistently coming first in my class until graduation. The strong academic environment pushed me to stay focused and motivated.</p>
            <p>After graduating from SK Pakatan Jaya, I moved again to SK Bandar Seri Putra for high school. This change brought fresh challenges as I adjusted to a new school culture and made new friends. It was a time when I learned the value of resilience and perseverance, as each move taught me how to start over, build connections, and stay committed to my studies.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote-text">"These experiences shaped who I am today, instilling in me the adaptability, determination, and social skills that have carried me through various stages of life."</blockquote>

            <h2>Sports and the Pursuit of Excellence</h2>
            <p>Sports were a big part of my school life, but not because I wanted to have fun — it was because I wanted to be perfect and successful in everything I did. From the start, my motivation to join sports like hockey in primary school and netball from Form 1 onwards was fueled by a relentless desire to excel, not just academically but in any field I took on.</p>
            <p>Competing at the district level in sports was more than just an opportunity; it was a chance to push myself and prove that I could succeed in every arena, not just the classroom. I wanted to be the person who could handle it all — the student who aced their exams and the athlete who played with intensity and skill. The idea of being well-rounded and mastering multiple areas motivated me to train hard, practice relentlessly, and never settle for anything less than my best.</p>
            <p>Being part of a team taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork and leadership. It showed me how to support my teammates, understand different strengths, and push through tough matches when things weren't going our way. The discipline needed to stay committed to practices and competitions helped me build a strong work ethic that carried over into everything else I did.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote-text">"For me, sports were never just about winning; they were about the pursuit of excellence and proving that I could be successful in all aspects of life."</blockquote>
