            </a>
        </div>
        <p>Above is a collage of our family tree, capturing our heritage and the connections that bind us.</p>
        
        <h1>About My Family</h1> 
        <p>My family has always been the core of who I am, each member contributing in their unique way. My father is truly the heart of our family—kind, understanding, and supportive. I don’t know what life would be like without him. It’s hard to imagine living without my parents, but here I am, coping without my mother for the past four years. She passed away on June 17, 2020, during the PKP period due to thyroid issues. My mom was strict, and it was her discipline that shaped me into who I am today. If it weren't for her firmness, I might not have reached the milestones I have achieved so far.</p>

        <p>My brother is 16 now, four years younger than me. Growing up, we fought a lot, and our mother would always scold us for it, saying we needed to get along. Those fights seem like distant memories now, especially since 2020, when our relationship shifted. We don’t argue anymore, and I’ve become more reserved, preferring my own company. In contrast, my younger sister, who is now 9 years old, and I share a different kind of bond. We’re like friends; she talks a lot, and I’m always there to listen to her stories. She has a way of making me smile and often asks me to buy her things, playfully treating me like her personal ATM.</p>

        <p>Despite our differences, the love we share as a family keeps us strong, even as we navigate life without our mother. Through it all, we remain connected, finding strength in the memories we cherish and the bond we continue to build.</p>
