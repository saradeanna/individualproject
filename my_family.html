        <p>Above is a collage of our family tree, capturing our heritage and the connections that bind us.</p>
        
        <h1>About My Family</h1> 
        <p>My family has always been the core of who I am, each member contributing in their unique way. My father is truly the heart of our family—kind, understanding, and supportive. I don’t know what life would be like without him. It’s hard to imagine living without my parents, but here I am, coping without my mother for the past four years. She passed away on June 17, 2020, during the PKP period due to thyroid issues. My mom was strict, and it was her discipline that shaped me into who I am today. If it weren't for her firmness, I might not have reached the milestones I have achieved so far.</p>

        <p>My brother is 16 now, four years younger than me. Growing up, we fought a lot, and our mother would always scold us for it, saying we needed to get along. Those fights seem like distant memories now, especially since 2020, when our relationship shifted. We don’t argue anymore, and I’ve become more reserved, preferring my own company. In contrast, my younger sister, who is now 9 years old, and I share a different kind of bond. We’re like friends; she talks a lot, and I’m always there to listen to her stories. She has a way of making me smile and often asks me to buy her things, playfully treating me like her personal ATM.</p>

        <p>Despite our differences, the love we share as a family keeps us strong, even as we navigate life without our mother. Through it all, we remain connected, finding strength in the memories we cherish and the bond we continue to build.</p>

                        <big>Syakir</big> is the nickname our family uses. We didnt use nickname like angah or abang. Syakir is a second born in my family 
                        which is also my younger brother. He is 16 years old this year and has a stubborn yet quiet personality. He has a strong passion 
                        for kapcais and owns his own motor, which he enjoys modifying. The loud sound of his motor’s exhaust doesn’t bother him, and he even
                        finds it exciting. He is currently studying at KV Juasseh, taking an electrical course, which suits his practical and hands-on nature. 
                        Although he is not very talkative, he often shows his care through subtle actions like helping out when needed or fixing things around 
                        the house. </font>

                      <big>Sofea</big> is my younger sister and is the last siblings in my family. My younger sister is 9 years old and stands out among her friends 
                      because of her height, as she is taller than most of them. She has a calm and caring personality, especially when it comes to animals. Like me, 
                      she loves cats and takes care of our pet whenever I’m away at college. Her favorite food is “kari,” and she enjoys playing Roblox during her free time. 
                      She is currently studying at SK Padang Lebar in Kuala Pilah. Despite her young age, she is mature and thoughtful, often surprising us with her responsible 
                      and considerate nature. He also loves to sing random songs. one of the songs is
